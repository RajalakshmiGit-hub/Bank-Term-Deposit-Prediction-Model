# Bank-Term-Deposit-Prediction-Model
Bank has multiple banking products that it sells to customer such as saving account, credit cards, investments like Term Deposit, Recurring Deposit etc. The investment department of the Bank would want to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term deposits. Once it can predict the chances that customer will purchase a product, the marketing managers can carefully tune their directed campaigns to these customer to improve the Bank performance.

We will do data cleaning, data exploration,dealing with class imbalance and then figure out a robust machine learning algorithm for predicting the potential customers who would subscribe to the term deposit using different Machine learning library.

## Objectives

- Data cleaning
- Data exploration
- Feature extraction
- Developing a robust machine learning algorithms.
